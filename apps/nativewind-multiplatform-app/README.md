# NativeWind multiplatform demo

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app), showing how TailwindCSS styles can be used in React Native apps.

This app can be built for web, mobile devices (iOS, iPadOS, and Android), and TV devices (Apple TV, Android TV).

You can see the web version at

https://nativewindmultiplatform.expo.app/

Some of the packages used:

- The [React Native TV fork](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos), which supports both phone (Android and iOS) and TV (Android TV and Apple TV) targets
- The [React Native TV config plugin](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/config-tv/tree/main/packages/config-tv), to allow Expo prebuild to modify the project's native files for TV builds
- The [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) package which lets you use Tailwind CSS in react-native.
- The [expo-router native tabs](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/native-tabs/) feature in Expo SDK 55

## 🚀 How to use

- `cd` into the project

- Build for mobile devices (including iPad tablet support)

```sh
yarn
yarn prebuild # Executes a clean Expo prebuild to generate iOS and Android native files
yarn ios # Build and run for iOS
yarn android # Build and run for Android
```

- Build for TV devices

```sh
yarn
yarn prebuild:tv # Executes a clean Expo prebuild to generate tvOS and Android TV native files
yarn ios # Build and run for Apple TV
yarn android # Build and run for Android TV
```

- Web (local development)

```sh
yarn
yarn web # Runs the web app as a local development server on port 8081
```

- Web (deploy to EAS hosting)

```sh
yarn
eas init
yarn build:web # Build the web deployment bundle
yarn deploy:web # Deploy to the EAS hosting dev environment
```

> **_NOTE:_**
> Setting the environment variable `EXPO_TV=1` enables the `@react-native-tvos/config-tv` plugin to modify the project for TV.
> This can also be done by setting the parameter `isTV` to true in the `app.json`.

## 📝 Notes

The UI is derived from the [NativeWind example app](https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind/tree/main/examples/expo-router) plus [this Tailwind CSS example](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/premium-banner-around-button). It includes [custom CSS transforms](./global.css).

### Theming

Theming and dark/light mode support are provided by the [global CSS file](./global.css). It contains dark and light versions of the custom colors used in the app, as well as custom scale factors for scaling buttons when they are focused, hovered, or active. The colors are the same as those used in the default template used when creating new Expo Router apps.

The [root layout](./app/_layout.tsx) sets the theme as the style in the root view.

The [themed components](./components) demonstrate how to use NativeWind class names and the custom colors to provide consistent text, button, and link appearance. These are used both in the [home screen](<./app/(tabs)/index.tsx>) and the [tab layout for web](./components/app-tabs.web.tsx).

### Tab layout

The app provides a [native tab layout](./components/app-tabs.tsx) using `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs`.

For web and Android TV, the [web tab layout](./components/app-tabs.web.tsx) uses the [custom tab layout](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/custom-tabs/) feature of Expo Router.

### Focus, hover, and active styles

These are shown in the [focus/hover/active demo screen](<./app/(tabs)/tvdemo.tsx>).

- The buttons are styled with `focus:bg-blue-300` and `active:bg-green-600`. On TV, the `focus` prefix causes the style to be applied to controls when `onFocus()` is invoked, and the style is removed when `onBlur()` is invoked. On both TV and mobile, the `active` prefix applies the style when `onPressIn()` is invoked, and removes it when `onPressOut()` is invoked.
- The buttons are also styled with `hover:bg-blue-300`, to apply that style when the mouse hovers over the button in the web version of the app.
- Finally, `transition duration-500` is applied so that the focus, blur, and hover transitions happen smoothly with an animation.

### Compatibility with third party components

In NativeWind v4, the [CSSWrappedComponents.tsx](./components/CSSWrappedComponents.tsx) file demonstrated how to wrap components provided by Expo and other packages to enable them to use NativeWind class names, using [the `cssInterop()` API](https://www.nativewind.dev/api/css-interop). In NativeWind v5, this is no longer needed — components are imported directly from their original packages. The `@expo/rncss-components` package in this repository provides CSS wrappers for the components used in the app, using the `react-native-css` package, and provides a custom Metro config so that imports from `react-native` and other packages are properly redirected to those wrappers.

## Changes from SDK 55 (NativeWind v4) to v5

### Import path changes

- Component imports renamed from PascalCase to kebab-case (e.g. `@/components/ThemedText` → `@/components/themed-text`, `@/hooks/useScreenDimensions` → `@/hooks/use-screen-dimensions`)
- `@/layouts/TabLayout` → `@/components/app-tabs`
- Removed `CSSWrappedComponents` barrel import — now imports directly from original packages (`SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context`, `Image` from `expo-image`, `LegendList` from `@legendapp/list`)

### NativeWind v5 CSS variable syntax

- Square bracket syntax replaced with parenthetical syntax: `bg-[--color-background]` → `bg-(--color-background)`
- Custom CSS variable text colors now use `!important` modifier: `text-[--light-theme-fg]` → `text-(--light-theme-fg)!`

### Component API changes

- `ThemedText` now uses `color="none"` and `additionalClassName` props instead of direct `className` overrides
- `ThemedText` bold/font/animation styles use `!important` suffix (e.g. `font-bold!`, `animate-bounce!`)
- Removed `useColorScheme` toggle button from the home screen
- Image transform classNames changed to named classes (`translateimage`, `scaleimage`)
- `LegendList` gained `showsScrollIndex={false}` prop

### Video screen rewrite

- The `VideoTest` component import was replaced with an inline `VideoDemo` component featuring direct use of `expo-video` (`useVideoPlayer`, `VideoView`), playback controls (play/pause, rewind, seek, fullscreen), a custom `ProgressBar` component, and a `useInterval` hook for tracking progress
